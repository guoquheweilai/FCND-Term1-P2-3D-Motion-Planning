# FCND-Term1-P2-3D-Motion-Planning

## Overview
This is the project 2 of term 1 in [Flying Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/flying-car-nanodegree--nd787) on Udacity.  
The code communicates with [Udacity FCND Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases) using [Udacidrone](https://udacity.github.io/udacidrone/) API.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following software installed:  
- [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) with Python 3.6.x  
- [Udacity FCND Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases)

## Setup Instructions (abbreviated)
1. Download [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and then install by opening the file/app that you download.  
2. `git clone https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit.git` to clone the starter kit and then cd FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit into that directory. If you have a windows machine, you must rename meta_windows_patch.yml to meta.yml as well.  
3. `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create the miniconda environment: this took me 20 minutes to run due to the large number of installs required.  
4. `source activate fcnd` to activate the environment (you'll need to do this whenever you want to work in this environment).
